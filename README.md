# Interactive-Hypothesis-Testing-App
The Interactive Hypothesis Testing App allows users to perform common statistical hypothesis tests in an intuitive and visual way. It supports three types of tests: One-Sample t-test, Two-Sample t-test, and Proportion Test. Users can input their data and parameters, run the tests, and instantly view the results and visualizations. This app simplifies the process of hypothesis testing, making it accessible for students, researchers, and anyone interested in data analysis. With an intuitive interface, it eliminates the need for programming knowledge to perform complex statistical calculations. To get started, users can visit the app's URL, select a test type, input their data and parameters in the sidebar, and click "Run Test." The results and visualizations will appear in the "Results" tab. For additional guidance, the "Help" tab provides an overview of hypothesis testing and explains the supported tests. This app was created by Shawn Malik, Billy Kitchel, and Andy Chen.

This is a ShinyRApplication.
